## Introduction

### Current Setup time: 
1-2h

### We need help here:
The current time to set up hypothes.is doesn't allow scaling of contributions to our projects.

To improve that, we are setting up a **docker compose file** so we can ideally reduce the installation time **to a few minutes**.

Help us making the installation faster for everyone: https://github.com/WorldBrain/infrastructure/issues/17


### How to install Hypothes.is/WorldBrain on your local machine:

 1. Go to the [Hypothes.is documentation](https://h.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hacking/install.html) and follow the installation instructions.
 2. Add any open questions or improvement suggestions of the installation process to [the bug tracker in this repo](https://github.com/WorldBrain/START-HERE/issues).
