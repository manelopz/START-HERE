#Acknowledgements

This project would have not been possible with the help, goodwill, constructive criticism and insights of many people along this journey.

I am endlessly grateful for living in a society, which gave me the security and intellectual freedom to think about solving social problems like this.

**But without one person, WorldBrain probably wouldn’t be, where it is today.** 

My mother, Margit Sauter.

Not only would I not be alive (obviously), but without her caring mindset and emotional perspectives, I likely would not have cared enough to start thinking about social problems like this.

And most importantly I would not have been able to push the project with such intensity.

She put enormous trust in me and lend me enough money to channel my full focus on this project - basically granting me a basic income. Not having to worry how my next rent will be paid, she gave me the freedom to fully concentrate on WorldBrain. It was the key to the most valuable experience and time of my life. 
I know how hard this decision was for you and I will never forget this. Ever. Thank you, Mom!

**Another awesome human being,** who had an important impact on making this project a reality is **Isabell Mohr**. Her compassion and selfless spirit was something I never experienced before and her way of ‘being’ is infectious to me. 

She supported the project financially several times as well as granting me parts of a new loan to bridge the gap between now and an initial outside investment in the project.

Her help was incredibly valuable and will also never be forgotten.
I hope on a great future working together and making this place, we call home, a better one for everyone. Thank you for your support and love!

To define the concept of WorldBrain, I was highly dependent on the insights and help from a special kind of people on the internet: Skeptics. 
Especially one particular group was so unexpectedly caring and helpful: **The Skepti-Forum**. 

I cannot thank you guys enough for the hours you spent skyping with me, helping me to find solutions to important challenges and evaluating the concept further. 

At this point I have to especially thank **Raymond Eckert, Richard Green, Mike Lewinski, Arthur Doucette, Marc Brazeau** and **Anastasia Bodnar**.

A special thanks goes out to the **ProjectTogether** and **Christoph Pröschel** for investing more than 4 months of his time for a weekly status and progress call, giving feedback, debating, laughing hard and exchanging ideas. 
This was enormously joy- and helpful. 
We are going to work together for a long time. I feel it!

Also, I have to thank **Chris Armbruster** and **Jeffrey Cobb** for investing their precious private time in helping me and other educational startups through the important customer and concept evaluation process.
