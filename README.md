## What is this project about?

Our grand goal is to develop a fact-checking browser plugin for the public. This will make it possible to instantly see, if a web article or blog post and its statements are trustworthy or not, based on how correct they represent scientific findings. As you can imagine developing such a plugin itself is not the real issue. Getting the content is.

It was also clear clear that millions of articles and tens of millions of statements cannot be verified with pure volunteer work (like on f.e. Wikpedia).

So our approach is to build productivity tools for the scientifically literate and critically thinking crowd needed for a trustworthy and perspective-rich verification of web-content: Skeptics, science writers and scientists.

We see our role in providing the framework for this community to do efficient online research, to improve interdisciplinary collaboration and to let the users effortlessly share accumulated knowledge with the community and the public. This will then lay the foundation to collectively uncover and display misinformation in the media.
To make this possible we contribute our work to the hypothe.is project.

For more see our roadmap: www.worldbrain.io/2016/roadmap/

For the next 2 years, our focus has to be solely on developing the best tools for skeptics to do more efficient research. Only then we will have a sustainable foundation to start building software to verify web-content in the most efficient way.
