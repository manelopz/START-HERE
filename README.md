## Purpose of this repository

Welcome to the WorldBrain project and great that you are also interested in improving the quality of humanity's greatest invention, the internet. :tada: :+1:

This Repo is all about coordinating people in their efforts to find the right ressources to inform themselves and to know where they can contribute best to the development of WorldBrain.

For any improvement suggestions for documentation and onboarding, please [(add an issue to this repo)](https://github.com/WorldBrain/START-HERE/issues).

## What is WorldBrain about?

As the WorldBrain project, our long term vision is to develop a browser plugin to see if an article or blog post you read is trustworthy, based on how well it represents scientifically verifiable facts. 
Our work will be to research and develop ways to make verfication of web content scalable and trustworthy.

**For more detailed information on how we want to accomplish this,** [check out our roadmap](https://github.com/WorldBrain/VISION-ROADMAP-FEATURES/blob/master/README.md).


### Our first project: *WorldBrain's Webmarks*

WorldBrain Webmarks is an open souce web research tool for science communicators like science journalists, skeptics and scientists. It aims to make the 2 main elements of online research more efficient: **Content Discovery and Knowledge Management**

#### Key Features
 - Automatically retrieving related content and meta information for articles, blog posts and scientific papers from a **personal/science community-trusted** network of blogs, news outlets, facebook groups/pages and scholarly(PubMed) or governmental(FDA) databases.
 - Performing individual searches through all of those sources at once, instead of searching every page manually or the whole web via google. 
 - Bookmarking, annotating, sharing and discussing web content with the community and the public. 
 
**[See more details about the tool, the development roadmap and how to contribute](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks/edit/master/README.md)**



However, the goal of this tool is to build a community of scientifically literate individuals to gather important meta data about the quality of web content and (in the long term) to ultimately train algorithms to detect various topic specific arguments on the internet.

In a second stage, we then apply those algorithms on a larger amount of web content allows creating a list of the most influential arguments. These can then be verified with crowdsourced templates that we can link back to the exact location where they appear. This can potentially lay the foundation for a large scale verification of web content.
