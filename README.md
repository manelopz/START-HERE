## Purpose of this repository

Welcome to the WorldBrain project and great that you are also interested in improving the quality of humanity's greatest invention, the internet. :tada: :+1:


This Repo is all about coordinating people to answer 3 questions:
 1. What is the vision and long-, medium- and short-term road map?
 2. Where can I contribute the best?
 3. Where can I send feedback to improve onboarding and documentation? [(Please add your suggestions to the issue tracker here)](https://github.com/WorldBrain/START-HERE/issues).

## What is WorldBrain about?

As the WorldBrain team, our grand mission is to develop a browser plugin to see if an article or blog post you read is trustworthy, based on how well it represents scientifically verifiable facts. 
Our work will be to research and develop ways to make verfication of web content scalable and trustworthy.

**For more detailed information on how we want to accomplish this,** [check out our roadmap](https://github.com/WorldBrain/VISION-ROADMAP-FEATURES/blob/master/README.md).


### Our first project: *WorldBrain's Webmarks*

As a first step we see it as necessary to provide a service to the groups of people needed to make these verifications trustworthy, efficient and lasting.
Namely, these are skeptics, science writer, scientists and [STEM students](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics).

The provided service is an advanced, but simple to use bookmarking tool, that lets people annotate websites with commentary and share those annoations publicly or privately.

**For a list of all features, visit our website:** [www.worldbrain.io](http://www.worldbrain.io)

We build this service on the basis of [Hypothes.is](http://www.hypothes.is), an already well developed open-source project, which aims to add a new layer of annotated commentary to the web. 

Many planned functionalities of *WorldBrain's Webmarks* overlap with Hypothes.is roadmap. 

That is why as the WorldBrain team, we try to contribute to Hypothes.is' core software wherever it is possible.
Together with Hypothes.is we want to form a lively community around our common goal: 

**Increased (scientific) literacy in our global society through a better information quality on the internet.**



<br>
## Who is working on it?

With the WorldBrain Team, we are now contributing to the work of the [Hypothes.is project and its team](https://hypothes.is/team/). 
In the future we will be working together closely on our common goal of a better internet.
