## What are we developing here?
As the WorldBrain team, our goal is to develop a browser plugin to see if an article or blog post you read is trustworthy, based on how well it represents scientifically verifiable facts.

As a first step we see it as necessary to provide a service to the groups of people needed to make these verifications trustworthy, efficient and lasting.
Namely they are skeptics, science writer, scientists and [STEM students](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics).

The service we see as necessary is an advanced, but simple to use bookmarking tool.
It lets people save bookmarks with annotations directly in the website, which are sharable and discussable with other people. Publicly or privately.

It is also possible to save contextual information to them, like individual comments and images. 
Similarly important: It lets users find those bookmarks and quotes again in a fast way.

We see this software in [Hypothes.is](http://www.hypothes.is), an already well developed open-source project, which aims to add a new layer of annotated commentary to the web.

Hypothes.is is an enabling software for WorldBrain and many other projects in the future, that will contribute to a better information quality of humanities greatest device, the internet. 

But there is still work to do, in order to make Hypothes.is the platform it needs to be.
That is why as the WorldBrain team we focus on contributing to Hypothes.is' development and help making this software as sustainable and useful to the world as possible.

WorldBrains goal is still researching and developing ways for gathering the necessary data to make scalable and convenient fact-checking of web content a reality.
Now, we are looking forward to make Hypothes.is some wickedly nice piece of software and form a lively community around our common goal: 

**Increased (scientific) literacy in our global society through a better information quality on the internet.**
