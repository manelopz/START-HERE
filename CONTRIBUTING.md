## Purpose of this repository

To coordinate the different possible types of contributions to the WorldBrain/Hypothes.is projects.

**If you want to stay updated** about the development progress, [subscribe](www.worldbrain.io/2016/blog/) to our 2 minutes video, which is published every 2nd wednesday [on our blog](www.worldbrain.io/2016/blog/).
There we talk about what happened in the last 2-weeks sprint and what will happen in the next.

## What are we developing here?
As the WorldBrain team, our goal is to develop a browser plugin to see if an article or blog post you read is trustworthy, based on how well it represents scientifically verifiable facts. 
Our work will be to research and develop ways to make verfication of web content scalable and trustworthy.

For more on how we think we can reach this goal, visit: www.worldbrain.io 

As a first step we see it as necessary to provide a service to the groups of people needed to make these verifications trustworthy, efficient and lasting.
Namely, these are skeptics, science writer, scientists and [STEM students](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics).

The provided service is an advanced, but simple to use bookmarking tool.

**The main features are:**
- Save bookmarks with annotations that are visible directly in the website and add comments, images and meta data.
- Share and discuss them with other people. Publicly or privately.
- Find those bookmarks fastly and and transfer their content everywhere with just 2 clicks.

We see this service in [Hypothes.is](http://www.hypothes.is), an already well developed open-source project, which aims to add a new layer of annotated commentary to the web.
Hypothes.is' software is an enabling platform for WorldBrain and many other projects in the future, that will contribute to a better information quality of humanity's greatest device, the internet. 

But there is still work to do, in order to make Hypothes.is the platform it needs to be.

That is why as the WorldBrain team, we focus on contributing to Hypothes.is' development and help making this software as sustainable and useful to the world as possible.

WorldBrains goal is still researching and developing ways for gathering the necessary data to make scalable and trustworthy fact-checking of web content a reality.
But now, we are looking forward to make Hypothes.is some wickedly nice piece of software and form a lively community around our common goal: 

**Increased (scientific) literacy in our global society through a better information quality on the internet.**
