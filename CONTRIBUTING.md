## Current state of development

We just published our first proof of concept with the channel "Related Content" which is powered by [Laterals News API](https://lateral.io/publishing) and is broadcasted into a [Hypothes.is group](https://hypothes.is/groups/KG9bL1Bm/related-articles).

**[>> Check out the working demo and the near term development roadmap](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks/blob/master/README.md)**

Currently we are working on the feature of retrieving relevant content from a **science community-trusted** network of blogs, news outlets, facebook groups/pages and scholarly(PubMed) or governmental(FDA) databases.
