Of course the tool should be beautiful to look at and not only handy to use.
Leave your mark on the web with a tool "quite a a bunch" of people will use in the future...every day. :)

## (Online-) Journalism
Validating an idea and having deep understanding about an industry are two different things. 
Our goal is to be deeply embedded in the process of journalists and other heavy web-researchers, which is why there is a need for people who understand the world of online journalism and a who have a feeling for what innovations are going to be highly relevant in the future.

## Open-Source Project Management
A major part of the next 2 years will be coordinating the open source endeavor of WorldBrain. That is why it is important to have people on board with extensive experience about Open Source Project Management.

## Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
To build the structure of the data analysis efficiently and sustainably right from the start, there is a need for team members with an advanced expertise in NLP and ML.

## Game-design
A lot of elements of the resulting community will be approached with game-design thinking. The question is: How can we make participation fun and rewarding for the users?
